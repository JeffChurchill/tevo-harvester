## TEvo Harvester
TEvo Harvester is a tool to populate your own local database tables with a cache of the [Ticket Evolution API](http://developer.ticketevolution.com/) data. It allows you to very easily create, populate, and update tables with the cache-able API data and includes the ability to easily schedule for this data to be updated periodically.

This application can and should be separate from whatever project you are creating to utilize the data. This keeps the underlying technologies, dependencies, and requirements separate from your main project and allows you to update this project as necessary without affecting other projects you are building that utilize the data stored by this application.
